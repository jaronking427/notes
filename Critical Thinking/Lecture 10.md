## Looking Beyond: Predicates & Quantifiers 
```
All cats are mammals 
Spinoza is a cat 
C: Spinoza is a mammal
```
>Spinoza (Subject) is a cat (Predicate)
>Cannot formalize, the best we can do is just A
>All (Quantifier) cats (Predicate) are Mammals(Predicate)
>A
>B
>C: C

Need to 'split the atom'
> Way of formalizing subject and predicate 
> Sentence letters: A, B, C
> Predicates: F, G, H
> Names: a, b, c
> Variables: x, y, z
> Quantifiers $\forall$, $\exists$
> F:  is a cat
> a: Spinoza
> $\forall$Fa

Argument 
>$\forall$x(Fx$\implies$Gx)
>Fa
>C: Ga

$\forall$x$A$ - for all x, $A$
Ex$A$ - for some x, $A$

```
Someone is happy
Someone is unhappy
Not everyone is happy
Not everyone is unhappy
Everyone loves someone
```
> $\exists$xFx F is happy in the domain of all people
> $\exists$x$\neg$Fx Something in the domain of all people lacks what F formalizes (Happiness)
> $\neg\forall$xFx
> $\neg\forall$x$\neg$Fx

The godfather is not long and boring 
```

>($\neg$L) $\land$B
```
Everyone loves someone
```  
>L -> Lab
>$\forall$x$\exists$yLxy <-More moderate reading
>Domain all people
>Each person loves somebody
>$\exists$y$\forall$xLxy <-Strong reading
>There is someone whom everyone loves 
```
Everyone loves themselves
Therefore everyone loves someone
```
>$\forall$xLxx
>C: $\forall$x$\exists$yLxy
>VALID
>$\forall$xLxx
>C: $\exists$y$\forall$xLxy
>INVALID
```
Everyone knows themselves
C: There is someone everyone knows

Everyone is as tall as themselves
C: There is someone who is as tall as everyone
```
'=' allow us to count, express uniqueness
