## Definition
A sequence of declarative sentences, the last of which is a [[Conclusion]] the others are called the [[Premise|premises]]. Arguments are typically given informally, in flowing prose, but not in this class. 
## Structure
An argument follows a typical logical structure and can be analysed in the following fashion for [[Validity|validity]].
- What is the [[Conclusion|concluison]]
- What are the [[Premise|premises]]
- Does the [[Conclusion]] follow the [[Premise|premises]]
## Types of arguments
### Deductive arguments
An argument that uses [[Validity|deductive validity]]. A good deductive argument is a [[Validity|valid]] argument.
##### Example
```
1. All Fs are Gs
2. x is an G
3. Therefore x is a F
```
### Inductive Arguments
Inductive arguments are arguments that use [[Induction]] and probability. A good inductive argument is a strong argument. 
##### Example 1
```
1. All 500 observed swans are white (T)
2. Therefore it is likely that all swans are white (F)
```
> This is a generalization, and black swans do exist which makes the [[Conclusion|conclusion]] false. However, the argument itself is strong. Say only 501 swans exist and there is one black swan. The argument that all swans are white at that point is very strong. 
##### Example 2
```
1. Most American citizens have naturally dark hair. (T)
2. Person A is an American citizen. (T)
3. Therefore, it is likely that person A has dark hair (F)
```
##### Example 3
```
1. I parked my car in the parking garage 5 hours ago, and it is no longer there
2. Therefore it must have been stolen
```
> Best most likely answer to the observation.
