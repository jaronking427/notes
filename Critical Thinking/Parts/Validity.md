## Definition 
In arguments an [[Argument]] can be valid if and only if the [[Premise|premises]] follow the [[Conclusion]]. Valid arguments structure our disagreements in philosophy. 
## Deductive Validity
An argument is deductively valid when there is **no way** for all of the [[Premise|premises]] to be true and the [[Conclusion|conclusion]] to be false. This means that it is itself contradictory to believe all of the premises but deny the conclusion. [[Formal Logic]] is  more concerned with deductive validity rather than inductive validity.
### Deductive Validity Examples
```
1. All men are mortal (T)
2. Socrates is a man (T)
3. Therefore socrates is mortal (T)
```
### Deductive Invalidity Examples
```
1. All men are mortal (T)
2. Socrates is mortal (T)
3. Therefore Socrates is a man (F)
```
> This argument is invalid because the scope of a mortal is much wider than the scope of a man. Suppose Socrates is a cat, all cats are mortal, but cats are not men. 
### Limitations of Deductive Validity
- Deductive validity does not allow for statistical interference 
- Statistical models cannot be brought into deductive validity
	- Validity that works with statistics is [[Induction]]
## Schemas
There are a wide arrange of true false schemas that present valid arguments. However, all true premises and a false conclusion is not a valid argument schema. 
### Examples of invalid schemas
##### Ex 1: Assume the teacher in class is wearing a green and black dress and is in the Folsom field stadium
```
1. I am wearing green (T)
2. I am wearing black (T)
3. We are in Eaton (F)
```
> [[Conclusion|Conclusions]] cannot contain more information than the [[premise]] statements provide. The two premise statements are true, but they do not provide relevant information to the conclusion. Therefore the [[Argument|argument]] is invalid. To test the theory erase the conclusion and see if you can come to it based on the premise statements. 
##### Ex 2: All true premises but invalid conclusion
```
1. If it is raining then I will give you a ride (T)
2. I gave you a ride (T)
3. Then it must have been raining (F)
```
> There are cases in which the conclusion will be false. Say that you broke your leg, and you got a ride to school. The fact that you got a ride to school does not guarantee that it was raining.
