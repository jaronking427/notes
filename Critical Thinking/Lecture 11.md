### Looking Beyond (ii) Identity
R .... is pointing at 
domain: all people
$$
\exists{x} \forall{y} {Rxy}
$$
"Someone is pointing at everyone"
### = Expressing uniqueness and counting
Whenever a,b are names, (a=b) is a sentence
Clark=Superman <- one in the same thing
"Numerical Identity" - "="
#### Uniqueness
'There is at least one cow' (Easy to fomalise) 
F: is a cow
$$\exists{xFx}$$
'There is at most one cow' (No way to represent it with first order logic)
$$\forall{x}\forall{y}(Fx\land{Fy}\implies{x=y})$$
'There are at least two cows' negation of the previous statement'
$$\exists{x}\exists{y}(Fx\land{Fy}\land\neg(x=y)$$
Paradox of 'Plato's Beard'
"Unicorns don't exist" 
U=Unicorn
$$\neg\exists{x}Ux$$
"Pegasus doesn't exist" <- issue is Pegasus is a name
- How to make sense of non existence claims
$$\neg\exists{x}(x=a)$$
Pegasus needs to have a referance in order for it to be true
"The present king of France is bald"
__Should not exist__
Want to say * is false because the present king of France does not exist
$$Fa\implies\exists{x}(x=a)$$Not a correct way of formalization 
a: The present king of France
Different formalization of *
$$\exists{x}(Kx\land\forall{y}(Ky\implies{y=x})\land{Bx})$$
The statement * is false because
$$\neg\exists{xKx}$$

### Assignment Clarifications 
3. 'Using truth tables'
	- Add truth tables 
	- .5pt on tautology .5pt on truth table
4. 2 contradictions in a statement then the conjunction is a contradiction (T/F)
