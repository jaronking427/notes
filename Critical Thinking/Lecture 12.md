## 
Knowledge = Belief + True + Good reason/Good method/Good evidence ... (JUSTIFICATION)
Justification truth belief (JTB) Theory of knowledge: To know some thing is to have a true belief with some justification. (Fundamentally wrong)
- Edmund Gettier (Gettier case): Cases in which one has a justified belief which is true only by lucky coincidence so not knowledge.
### Examples 
1. Ana, Bob. "Ana believes bob owns a car. Belief. Justified because she sees bob drive a car around time all the time. True but for completely irrelevant reasons" - "Bob may drive the car, but he does not own the car" Have JTB, but without knowledge 
2. Andrew. "Looks at clock, and sees 9 am, and forms the belief that it is 9am". This belief is true, and justified. "The clock is broken, and he happened to look at the clock when the time was correct, JTB but no knowledge."
### Causal theory
- avoids gettier cases
- Has problems with..
	- Knowledge of the future
	- Mathematical or logical knowledge 
		- 2+2=4 <- Exists outside causal frame(Abstract object)
