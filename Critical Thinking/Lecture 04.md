## Logical Form
- Content vs form
- Logical constants 
	- 'and', 'or', 'not'
	- "if    Then" "if and only if" 
	- These are logical constants because they have truth functionality
	- Connective(Takes a sentence -> Spits out a new sentence)
	- One can calculate the truth of a bigger sentence from the values of the inputs
- Formal Validity
- Formal logic 
	- Propositional logic (Inside formal logic)
		- Truth functional logic <- Another name for formal logic 
- [[Validity|Deductive Validity]]
	- Formal Validity (As a special case)
		- An argument is formally valid if it has a valid form
		- Venn diagram 
			- Widercircle is a valid argument 
			- inner circle is a formally valid argument 
		- Example 1
			- **if** it is raining **then** jenny is upset
			- Its raining 
			- so jenny is upset 
		- Example 2 
			- **If** its day **then** its hot 
			- it is day 
			- therefore it is hot
		- Both arguments follow the If a then be: a: therefore b
			- They both follow the "Logical form"
		- Example 3:
			- Either jenny is happy **or** sad
				- Ask first what is the logical form of this premise????
				- A **or** B
		- Example 4:
			- **If** it rains **or** snows, **Then** the floor will be wet tomorrow
				- _What is the logical form?_
				- _How to formalize this_ (Identification of the logical form)
					- **if** (A **or** B) **then** C
		- Example 5:
			- **If** there is evil, **Then** there is no God
			- There is evil
			- Therefore there is no God
				- If A then B
				- A
				- B
		- Abstraction is good because it allows us to look at the form rather than the argument as a whole
