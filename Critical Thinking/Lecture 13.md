> What is the difference between knowledge and belief, confidence, etc
- 'JTB' Theory - can be analysed as belief + truth + justification
- Gettier cases: can have JTB, without knowledge
	- Alternative analyses 
		- Causal theory 
		- Safety theory 
	- These theories all have ""Knowledge" is belief plus ' '" 
		- Justification 
		- Evidences 
		- Causation 
	- "Our concept of belief is more basic... "

## "Knowledge-first" Epistemology
- Williamson: the concept of knowledge should be taken as basic un-analyzable and a starting point for understanding (eg) , Belief, Justification, ETC
	- Does not support conceptual analysis
- EG belief
	- Analogy: roundness and circularity 
		- Circularity is a precise concept 
		- Roundness has a looser definition 
		- Easier to go from the concept of circularity to roundness than it is to go from roundness to circularity 
	- Belief = attempted knowledge, or knowledge but without the requirements thereof
- Eg: Justification = 
	- You are justified in believing that A if and only if you know that A.
